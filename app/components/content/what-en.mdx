## So what to do?

We have to look for new, modern, creative and subversive ideas for preserving democracy and human rights, against hatred and hate speech. Doesn't matter if it's an app, a video, a website, a song, a club or an acrylic painting. Any idea is better than a nothing, and real impact is even better.

As part of the Augsburg Peace Festival, we want to work on these ideas together. More than 30 participants will join us over a long weekend from July 19 to 21 in a participatory festival format: _hcknzs_ is more than a hackathon or a conference, it's an **ideas festival**. We need to counter the Nazis and their shitty worldview with what we do best. In short, let's "hack" right-wing terror:

For three days, teams of coders, designers, digital natives, artists, makers, tinkerers, activists, politicians and many more will work together on concepts, build prototypes and develop actionist concepts. The _Hackathon_ principle is called: _Proof of Concept_! Long live the creative use of technology and skills, even if you are not a "hacker".
