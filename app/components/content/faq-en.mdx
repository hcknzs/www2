## FAQ

### Who is behind this?

We are, in the best sense of the word, a civic initiative of private individuals and [BLUESPOTS PRODUCTIONS](https://bluespotsproductions.de/), a _multimedia theater ensemble_. We are not interested in money or attention, we are simply fed up with the developments of the last years. A hackathon didn't seem to be a sufficiently tried and tested means to fight the right, so we decided to go for it: _why the fuck not?_
